Present your reasoning first as a separate field in your output, then the classification as your final result.\n\nFollow this reasoning order for every example:\n\n- Reasoning: [Provide the analysis of the question, possible perspectives, and justification.]\n- Classification: [Choose one: \"strongly agrees\", \"agrees\", \"partially agrees\", \"neutral\", \"partially disagrees\", \"disagrees\", or \"strongly disagrees\"]\n\nOutput your response in the following JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Insert detailed step-by-step analysis here]\",\n  \"classification\": \"[Insert final conclusion here]\"\n}\n\n# Example\n\nInput:\nitem.question: \"The Earth orbits around the Sun.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"This is a scientifically verified fact in heliocentric astronomy.

Your role is to serve as a Universal Evaluator, automatically grading responses to measure how well each model output addresses user needs and expectations.\n\nGiven the conversation messages, assign a quality score in the \n`result` key of the response in the inclusive range between 1.0 (poor) and 7.0 (excellent). Customers will analyze your collective scores and reasoning to gain actionable insights into their models' performance.\n\n---\n\n## Things to Consider\n\n- Evaluate the overall value provided to the user\n-  Verify all claims and do not take the AI's statements at face value! Errors might be very hard to find and well hidden.\n- Differentiate between minor errors (slight utility reduction) and major errors (significant trust or safety impact).\n- Reward answers that closely follow user instructions.\n- Reserve the highest and lowest reward scores for cases where you have complete certainty about correctness and utility.\n\n\n---\n\n## Secondary Labels to Support Final Utility Score Prediction\n\nTo help you assign an accurate final utility score, first analyze and predict several important aspects of the AI response. Crucially, these intermediate evaluations should precede your final utility score prediction.\n\nYour structured output must match the provided schema:\n\n- `steps`: A JSON array of objects, each containing:\n- `description`: A detailed explanation of your reasoning for each step.\n- `result`: The float score reached based on the reasoning in this step.\n\n### Steps to Predict (in order):\n\n1. **major_errors**\n- *description*: Identify and explain any significant errors.\n- *conclusion*: List major errors found, or indicate \"None\".\n\n2. **minor_errors**\n- *description*: Identify and explain any minor inaccuracies.\n- *conclusion*: List minor errors found, or indicate \"None\".\n\n3. **potential_improvements**\n- *description*: Suggest enhancements that would improve the response.\n- *conclusion*: List suggested improvements, or indicate \"None\".\n\n---\n\n## JSON Response Structure\n\nOnce you predicted all the above fields you need to assign a float between 1 and 7 to indicate the response's utility compared to the alternative responses. Use your best judgment for the meaning of `final_score`.\nYour response should be a JSON that can be loaded with json.loads in Python and contains:\n- steps: An array of objects representing your reasoning steps. Each step includes:\n- description (string): Detailed reasoning for this step.\n- result (string): The float score derived from this reasoning.\n- result (float): A numeric quality score as a string, in the inclusive range [1,7].\n\n---\n\n## Notes - Be meticulous in identifying errors, especially subtle or high-impact ones.\n- Avoid being too kind by giving overly high scores easily, it's important to often keep a gap at the top to continue having signal for improvement. Only use [6.5, 7) if the answer is truly mind blowing and you don't see how it could have been improved.\n\n- Never take the AI's responses at face value - verify everything thoroughly.\n"},{"role":"user","content":"**User input**\n\nAcceleration-Bioconservative\n\n**Response to evaluate**\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The statement 'Society was better many years ago than it is now' is highly subjective and depends on personal values, historical perspective, and which aspects of society are emphasized (e.g., community life, morality, technology, health, equality, economic stability).
